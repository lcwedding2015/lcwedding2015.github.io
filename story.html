                    <p>Chris and Liz first locked eyes in 2009 in their fashion history class. At the time Chris was extremely focused on his education and Liz was in a relationship so the only communication they had was staring, smiling, and the occasional awkward "Hi". Their love was arguably from a distance.</p>

                    <p>After about 2-3 months of class and no change in their silent love, Chris graduated, moved to Los Angeles and Liz continued her schooling.</p>

                <div class="story-section">
                    <p>Chris moved to Los Angeles with high hopes and strict goals for himself. He ended up moving in with Angie, our now honorary SoCal mom. Chris lived with Angie and her son for a few months while finding his way in this new big city. He had the opportunity to work with multiple companies and really find his niche. After a few months went by Chris was offered a position with True Religion Brand Jeans and knew this was the right fit for him. Soon after, Chris decided it was time to find his own apartment and really enjoy being a bachelor in such a new exciting life.</p>

                    <p>He was well on his way, new job, new apartment, new freedom. Little did he know that Liz (and unknowingly Ellcie) would be coming into his life.</p>

                    <p>Liz was enjoying her schooling and was looking forward to an upcoming field trip to Los Angeles, along with a handful of other lucky students. The group would be spending a couple days visiting various companies including Michael Stars, BCBG, and as it turns out, True Religion.</p>

                    <p>True Religion was their last stop after a busy first day. Upon arriving they were ushered into an empty conference room and told to wait for the former student who had arranged this visit. The girls were chatting and talking about their busy day and where they wanted to go for dinner, then Chris walked in. Instantly everyone's eyes went directly to Chris and the room got a bit tense, almost like the girls were all thinking the same thing "in fashion, straight, tall, cute, MINE!"</p>

                    <p>The whole time during the visit Chis and Liz went immediately back to their old ways...stare, look away, smile, stare. They both recognized each other but couldn't connect the dots on how they knew one another.</p>

                    <p>When the meeting was over the group was walked out by Chris. He chatted with everyone and Liz kept her eye on him from a distance. It was about time to go when Chris asked Liz to take a picture of him and his former teacher, which sparked their first conversation…finally.</p>

                    <p>A few very uncomfortable minutes of small talk went by and they started to remember how they knew one another. Of course being the stubborn people they are, neither acknowledged the elephant in the room. Yet somehow they both knew there was something really special between them.</p>

                    <p>Liz and her group decided to head to Santa Monica for dinner. Of course the girls somehow found themselves at Cabo Cantina taking full advantage (especially Liz) of the 2 for 1 drink specials. Their "chaperone" who was also their teacher mentioned that she had been in communication with Chris and he would be making an appearance. Immediately the girls knew it was everyone for their own.</p>

                    <p>Chris was pretty much tackled by drunk girls when he walked in. Again, Liz watched from a distance and strategized her move. For those of you who are unaware, Liz somehow has a tendency of getting what she wants. Always has and had no plans on not getting what she wanted that night!</p>

                    <p>Once the "newness" of Chris wore off some of the girls started to scatter. Liz noticed one of the girls went to the bathroom  leaving her seat unattended and saw this as the perfect moment to make her way into the conversation. Now, a few (or more) drinks in, their conversation was easy, like they had known each other for years. At one point Chris put his hand on Liz's leg and almost instantly could feel the daggers coming from the other girls in the group.</p>

                    <p>Won’t get into more details about the night, because it gets a bit fuzzy. But there was a lot of laughing, smiling, and of course alcohol. They were 100% infatuated with one another and couldn't wait to get to know more about each other.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <p>Since then we have gone to Cabo Cantina every February to re-live the day we fell in love. There hasn’t been a day that has gone by that we have not talked or thought about how lucky we are to have each other.</p>

                    <p>It has not always been smooth sailing, but we always manage to put one another first. We are so excited to share our love and the next step of our lives with our families and friends.</p>
